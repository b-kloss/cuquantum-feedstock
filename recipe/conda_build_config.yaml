# This is to make sure "mpi" above is *NOT* used to compute the package hash. For "cutensornet"
# the non-colliding hashes are acceptable (though not preferred if avoidable) because we
# wanted 3 flavors of "cutensornet" generated. But, for the "cuquantum" metapackage if the
# hashes are not colliding we'd also generate 3 packages (one for each "mpi" flavor), despite
# it has nothing to do with MPI. We better make sure we have colliding hashes, so that only
# 1 unique upload would be done by the CI.
